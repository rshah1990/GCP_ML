# built-in algorithms

- Built-in Algoriths covers gap between AUTO ML and full custom model. 
- you can select sepcific algorithm to train, it can also handle pre-processing , can do hyperparameter tuning & train model for you. 

# How to use it (XG boost)

## step 1 : select algorithm

## Step 2 : enable or disable automatic pre-processing 

## Step 3: define train, validation & test set 

## step 4: Define algorithm arguments like objective function , eval matrics 

## Step5: Hyperparameter tuning, define range of hyperparameter using hypertune. you can also define early stopping , max trials, no of parallel trails & objective function (Like minimize rmse)

## step 6: Define region & scale tier, submit
